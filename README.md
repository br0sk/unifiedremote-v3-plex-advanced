2. Download the Advanced Plex remote [zip package](https://github.com/br0sk/unifiedremote-v3-plex-advanced/archive/master.zip)
3. Unzip the package in a folder called Remotes in the same directory as you put the Unified Remote server executable in.
4. Launch the server and connect following the instructions [here](http://www.unifiedremote.com/3#windows)

## What's the plan?
I am planning to extend the functionality and follow the release cycle of Unified Remote version 3.+ so that it will be up to date and working properly.

Please try it out and report any bugs to me. Pull request are welcome.
